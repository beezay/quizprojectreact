# Note:

This one is my bootstrap project which I started long ago when I was new to learning REACT JS and started Web development.

# Project Overview

Here, we have some questions within `json` file and we have UI to show the question and options. Once the user clicks on the option s/he is taken to the next question.

Also user can go to previous and next question by skipping the current question.

# Latest Changes
As this project was setup long before so I made some few changes (latest changes on 26th June, 2023)
- react version updated
- UI updated with bootstrap
- json of questions updated with data structure changed
